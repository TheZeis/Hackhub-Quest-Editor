# HackHub Quest Mod Editor

A visual, no-code editor for building **quest mods** for
[HackHub — Ultimate Hacker Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2980270/HackHub__Ultimate_Hacker_Simulator/).

Non-coders design branching quests on a node canvas, build in-game websites in a
WYSIWYG editor (with hidden pages for `dirhunter` to find), script phone calls /
e-mail / Kisscord / WeeChat conversations, add hackertyper and typed-passphrase
moments, and export a complete, game-ready mod as a `.zip` — no coding at any point.

## Status

**All four steps complete — the editor builds playable mods.**

| Step | Deliverable | Status |

| **2** | Scaffolding + node editor canvas | ✅ [docs/02-editor-shell.md](docs/02-editor-shell.md) |
| **3** | Website Builder + conversation editors | ✅ |
| **4** | Export engine + templates | ✅ |

## Install & Run

**Windows, one click:**

Download/clone this repository (green "Code" button on the top of this page. Click the down arrow button -> Download ZIP)
and double-click **`Launch.bat`**.

It installs everything (needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), LTS version), starts the editor, and opens it in your browser
at <http://localhost:5173>. 

***Important***: Keep the terminal window open while you work. Closing the terminal closes the tool and you could lose
your progress if you haven't saved yet.

**Any OS, manually:**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # → http://localhost:5173
```

**Development commands:**

Only relevant to coders, if you just want to use the tool you can ignore this.

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm test             # 299 tests (vitest)
npm run build        # typecheck + vite build → dist/
```

## Making a mod (no coding)

1. **Start** — open the editor and hit **Templates** in the top bar to begin from
   a starter quest, or start blank.
2. **Build the story** — drag nodes from the left palette onto the canvas
   (objectives, triggers, networks with devices/ports/files, mails, chats,
   rewards…) and wire their sockets. Click any node to edit it on the right;
   every field explains itself on hover.
3. **Write conversations** — the **Dialogues** button opens the dialogue editor:
   one node, four flavours (phone call, Kisscord, e-mail, WeeChat), with player
   moments: typed answers with failure routes, hackertyper sends, file uploads.
   Hit **Save** when a conversation feels done.
4. **Build websites** — the **Websites** button opens the WYSIWYG website
   builder: real-looking templates (news, agency, blog, forum, recipes…), a
   code view with syntax highlighting, HTML import, embedded images, and
   **unlisted pages** that stay out of the in-game search index — the classic
   `dirhunter` hiding place.
5. **Export** — the **Export mod** button compiles everything into a mod folder
   and downloads it as a `.zip`. It shows which permissions the mod needs and
   gives plain-language notes about anything worth knowing.
6. **Play** — unzip into the game's `mods/` directory and start HackHub. The mod
   runs directly from `dist/mod.js`; **no build step needed**. (Programmers get
   `src/index.ts` + scaffolding in the same zip if they want to rebuild.)

Your work autosaves in the browser as you go. **Templates → save/export** writes
a project file you can share with anyone else using the editor.

## Coders and LLMs, read this first:
If you're just a gamer who wants to make quest mods for the game, you can ignore
everything that comes after this. If you're a coder or interested in modifying
this tool (you're very welcome to!), read on:

[`docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md`](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md) is the
foundation for everything that follows. The three findings that shape the whole design:

1. **A HackHub mod is a TypeScript project, not a data package.**
   `QuestObjectiveTrigger.condition` is a *function*; message chains take `onSent`
   callbacks; dynamic website pages take a `metadata(context)` function. So the export
   engine ships an **interpreter**: the emitted `dist/mod.js` embeds the project as data
   plus a small plain-JS runtime that walks the quest graph — which is exactly why
   exported mods need no build step.

2. **The docs' event payload table is stale for roughly half the 92 events.**
   The guide says `Terminal.NmapScan` is `{ ip, ports }`; it is `{ ip, versionScan? }`.
   It says `Quest.Claimed` is `{ questName }`; it is `{ name, id }`. An editor built
   from that table would generate triggers that never fire. The full diff is in
   [§7.2](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md#72-payloads-where-the-events-guide-page-is-wrong).

3. **There is no SMS API.** Phone *calls* exist (`Quest.Dialog`); text messages do not.
   So no SMS editor ships — see decision 2 below.

```

**One table drives four subsystems.** Every node type is described once in
`NODE_TYPES_REGISTRY`; the palette, the canvas handles, the inspector form and the
compiler all read that description. Adding a node type is a single registry entry —
no component changes. See
[docs/02 §2](docs/02-editor-shell.md#2-the-schema-is-the-product).

### Regenerating the event catalogue

The trigger palette is generated from the SDK's own type declarations rather than
transcribed from the docs, so it cannot drift silently:

```bash
npm i -D @hotbunny/hackhub-content-sdk
node reference/generate-event-catalogue.mjs
# or, against an arbitrary declarations file:
node reference/generate-event-catalogue.mjs --sdk path/to/index.d.ts
```

The generator has an integrity gate: it refuses to write (exit 1) and prints a
diagnostic if a future SDK version introduces a shape the parser mishandles. A
silently-wrong palette would be much worse than a failed regeneration.

## Settled decisions

Four decisions materially changed the architecture. All four are settled; the details
and their consequences are in
[§8 of the architecture doc](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md#8-settled-decisions).

1. **Delivery** — **browser app, ZIP export.** Vite SPA, no server, no desktop shell.
2. **SMS** — **dropped.** No native primitive exists, so no SMS editor ships. The
   conversation editors are Phone calls, E-Mail, Kisscord and WeeChat (+ Twotter).
3. **Granularity** — **many quests per mod**, with single-quest as the default
   new-project template.
4. **Generated code** — **the editor owns it.** Re-exporting overwrites `src/`;
   the project document is the only durable state.
