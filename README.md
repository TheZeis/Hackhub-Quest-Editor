# HackHub Quest Mod Editor

A visual, no-code editor for building **quest mods** for
[HackHub — Ultimate Hacker Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2980270/HackHub__Ultimate_Hacker_Simulator/).

Non-coders design branching quests on a node canvas, build in-game websites in a
WYSIWYG editor, script phone calls / e-mail / Kisscord / WeeChat conversations, and
export a complete, game-ready mod project as a `.zip`.

## Status

**Step 2 of 4 complete — the editor runs.**

| Step | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Schema analysis, tech stack, architecture | ✅ [docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md) |
| **2** | Scaffolding + node editor canvas | ✅ [docs/02-editor-shell.md](docs/02-editor-shell.md) |
| **3** | Website Builder + conversation editors | ⬜ |
| **4** | Export engine + templates | ⬜ |

---

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173

npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm test             # 275 tests (vitest)
npm run build        # typecheck + vite build → dist/
```

Drag a node from the left onto the canvas, wire its sockets, and edit it on the right.
Start from a template with the **Templates** button in the top bar.

## Read this first

[`docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md`](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md) is the
foundation for everything that follows. The three findings that shape the whole design:

1. **A HackHub mod is a TypeScript project, not a data package.**
   `QuestObjectiveTrigger.condition` is a *function*; message chains take `onSent`
   callbacks; dynamic website pages take a `metadata(context)` function. So the export
   engine is a **code generator**, and `npm install && npm run build` is the step that
   produces the `dist/mod.js` the game actually loads.

2. **The docs' event payload table is stale for roughly half the 92 events.**
   The guide says `Terminal.NmapScan` is `{ ip, ports }`; it is `{ ip, versionScan? }`.
   It says `Quest.Claimed` is `{ questName }`; it is `{ name, id }`. An editor built
   from that table would generate triggers that never fire. The full diff is in
   [§7.2](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md#72-payloads-where-the-events-guide-page-is-wrong).

3. **There is no SMS API.** Phone *calls* exist (`Quest.Dialog`); text messages do not.
   So no SMS editor ships — see decision 2 below.

    inspector/                      # registry-driven field renderer, event + condition
                                    #   pickers, list and network-device editors
    shell/                          # top bar, quest tabs, status bar, overlays
  templates/                        # starter quests (deterministic builds)
```

**One table drives four subsystems.** Every node type is described once in
`NODE_TYPES_REGISTRY`; the palette, the canvas handles, the inspector form and the
compiler all read that description. Adding a node type is a single registry entry —
no component changes. See
[docs/02 §2](docs/02-editor-shell.md#2-the-schema-is-the-product).

### Regenerating the event catalogue

The trigger palette is generated from the SDK's own type declarations rather than
transcribed from the docs, so it cannot drift silently:

```bash
npm i -D @hotbunny/hackhub-content-sdk
node reference/generate-event-catalogue.mjs
# or, against an arbitrary declarations file:
node reference/generate-event-catalogue.mjs --sdk path/to/index.d.ts
```

The generator has an integrity gate: it refuses to write (exit 1) and prints a
diagnostic if a future SDK version introduces a shape the parser mishandles. A
silently-wrong palette would be much worse than a failed regeneration.

## Settled decisions

Four decisions materially changed the architecture. All four are settled; the details
and their consequences are in
[§8 of the architecture doc](docs/01-analysis-and-architecture.md#8-settled-decisions).

1. **Delivery** — **browser app, ZIP export.** Vite SPA, no server, no desktop shell.
2. **SMS** — **dropped.** No native primitive exists, so no SMS editor ships. The
   conversation editors are Phone calls, E-Mail, Kisscord and WeeChat (+ Twotter).
3. **Granularity** — **many quests per mod**, with single-quest as the default
   new-project template.
4. **Generated code** — **the editor owns it.** Re-exporting overwrites `src/`;
   `.hackhub-quest-editor/project.json` is the only durable state.
